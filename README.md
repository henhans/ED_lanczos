# ExactDiagonalization Lanczos
Exact diagonalization of Hubbard chain using Lanczos algorithm.
The H|psi> calculation is parallelized using openmp, and the calculation is matrix free(no matrix is store in the memory). The cod can obtain correct ground state energy and wavefunction. The Green's function calculation is under construction.
