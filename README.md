# ExactDiagonalization Lanczos
Exact diagonalization of Hubbard chain using Lanczos algorithm.
The code can obtain correct ground state energy, however, the code is slow for the chain size L>=10.
Paralle sparse matrix multiplication can be aaply to speed up the calculation. The Green's function 
calculation is under construction.
